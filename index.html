### About Me
---
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, conducting research under the guidance of Dr. Jay Taneja at the STIMA Lab, situated at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**.

Previously, I completed my masters degree in Energy Engineering with Renewable option from the **University of Massachusetts Lowell**, and masters and bachelors degrees in Electrical Engineering from **North Carolina State University (NCSU)**.<br>

### Research Interests
---
I leverage **machine learning (ML) and satellite data** in order to support critical infrastructure (e.g., roads, electricity grid, and water resources) measurement and analysis, **sustainable development**, 
and understand the effect of anthropogenic **climate change** on water resources and the resulting impact on key sectors like **clean energy generation, agriculture and transport.** <br>


I specialize in the research field of distributed energy generation (DEG), focusing on technologies like solar PV, wind, and battery storage. My work involves the integration of these DEG systems into the electric grid, with a particular emphasis on both the U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa. Beyond this, my research interest extends to understanding the potential impact of renewable energy deployment on reducing reliance on fossil fuels. I am particularly intrigued by the prospect of how such deployments could address energy shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to sustainable and resilient energy solutions in the region.<br>

**Some of my ongoing projects include**:
- Exploring the Impact of Electric Cooking on the Grid in Nairobi, Kenya


### Experience
---
In my previous life, I was water transmission line inspector, a Software Engineer, a Fullstack Engineer, an ML engineer, and Teaching Assistant.
